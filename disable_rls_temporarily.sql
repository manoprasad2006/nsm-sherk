-- Quick Fix: Temporarily Disable RLS for New Accounts
-- This will allow the form to work immediately for all users

-- 1. Check current RLS status
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'sherk_stakes';

-- 2. Drop all existing policies to avoid conflicts
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own stakes" ON sherk_stakes;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can select own stakes" ON sherk_stakes;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own stakes" ON sherk_stakes;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own stakes" ON sherk_stakes;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own stakes" ON sherk_stakes;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable all operations for authenticated users" ON sherk_stakes;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read own sherk stakes" ON sherk_stakes;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create own sherk stakes" ON sherk_stakes;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own sherk stakes" ON sherk_stakes;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own sherk stakes" ON sherk_stakes;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can read all sherk stakes" ON sherk_stakes;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all sherk stakes" ON sherk_stakes;

-- 3. Disable RLS completely for now
ALTER TABLE sherk_stakes DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 4. Test that it works
SELECT 
  'RLS Disabled' as status,
  COUNT(*) as total_stakes
FROM sherk_stakes;

-- 5. Show current table status
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'sherk_stakes';
